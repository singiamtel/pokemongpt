# PokemonGPT

Very basic implementation of a Pokemon playing AI using GPT4o

The AI funny to watch but it's not very good.

Future optimizations could be:
- Tell the AI about the type table
- Give it more context (for example the likely set of the opponent's Pokemon, or the viability rankings of the tier)
- Retry move generation when it fails rather than just picking a random move
